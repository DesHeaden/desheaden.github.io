## Websites I Recommend
> [YouTube](https://youtu.be/x03-lTRN-bA?si=nzsSWxxZCghsNwwA) - _Youtube_ is a great website to watch endless amount of videos, and even movies or shows! I personally use it for music for studying purposes or to just vibe.

> [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com) - _Tiktok_ is one of America's favorite apps! Not only is there a bunch of funny videos, but a lot of us learn a ton of things from TikTok.
